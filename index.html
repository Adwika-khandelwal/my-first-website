          <p>Hobby is an activity which a person regularly engages in because of his/her interest in it.A hobby can be meaningful as well as something leisurely. People usually have hobbies like gardening, reading, collecting coins, singing, etc.Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.Painting requires you to be open-minded about how you will go about crafting the perfect art piece. It has undoubtedly helped me be open about how I view my imagination so that I can paint and make the best in my paintings.I do not articulate my mind on how the painting is supposed to be, but instead, just let my brush and my hand drive and inspire the painting.</p>
